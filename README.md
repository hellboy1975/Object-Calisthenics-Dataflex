Object-Calisthenics-Dataflex
============================

A collection of poorly written Object Calisthenics examples for DataFlex.

The code was written by Matt Smith as part of a presentation for the DDUG 2013 Corroborre in Bali, and contains some very basic examples of Object Calisthenics.

The code has neither been compiled or tested!

This project borrows heavily from this PHP based one:

I also got plenty of help from this website:
